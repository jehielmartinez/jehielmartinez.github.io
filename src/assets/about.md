My hobby has always been to create things, from small toys with Legos to real electronic gadgets for personal use. Im always doing something; I always have a project in mind and a tireless intellectual curiosity. This penchant for creating and learning things has led me to teach myself to program electronics devices as well as web and mobile applications. My professional goal is to provide quality service, as a trustworthy leader who will do everything possible to keep production and innovation in optimal values. ***Always ready to solve problems using engineering, dedication and a lot of coffee.***
